# Installing the HUD

Prior to release the only way to install the HUD (other than building it) is to download and install the [Work In Progress](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-hud/releases/tag/wip) release. Full instructions are on that page.

On release the HUD will be included with the ZAP [weekly release](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads#zap-weekly) and so will not need installing.

Once both the HUD and ZAP 2.8.0 have been officially released you will be able to install it from the ZAP Marketplace:

1. [Install](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) and start ZAP.
1. Click the ![Manage Add-ons](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/src/resource/icon/fugue/block.png?raw=true)**_Manage Add-ons_** button.
1. Select the **_Marketplace_** tab and search for **"HUD"**.
1. Select the add-on titled **"HUD - Heads Up Display"** and press **_Install Selected_**.

The HUD plugin should now be installed in ZAP.
